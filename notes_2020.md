## Day 0 - Example
Here, you see how we can ask questions and how an answer may look like.

### Questions and Issues
- I wrote `y <- 10`. Is it equivalent to writing `y = 10`?
    - No, not really! Although, most of the time it won't make much of a difference, but `<-` is the assignment operator. It gives (assigns) a name to a value while `=` is saying something is equal to something else. You should use `<-` everywhere except function calls, where you use `=`, like: `my_awesome_function(parameter = 42)`. Writing `=` instead of `<-` is also considered a **bad style** and you risk being loughed at by some more experienced R coders.
