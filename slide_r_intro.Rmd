# R is ...

* a programming language
* a programming platform (= environment + interpreter)
* a software project driven by the core team and the community
* a very powerful tool for statistical computing
* a very powerful computational tool in general
* a catalyst between an idea and its realization

# R is not ...

* a tool to replace a statistician
* the very best programming language
* the most elegant programming solution
* the most efficient programming language

# Ideas behind R

* open-source solution &mdash; fast development

--

* based on the [S language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_%28programming_language%29) created at the Bell Labs by [John Mc Kinley Chambers](https://bit.ly/2RhDqUx) to

> *turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully*

--

* [lexical scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28computer_science%29%23Lexical_scoping) inspired by [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp) syntax

--

* since 1997 developed by the R Development Core Team (ca. 20 experts, with Chambers onboard; 6 are active)

--

* overviewed by [The R Foundation for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/)

# Pros and cons

<i class='fa fa-minus-square'></i> steep learning curve  

--
<i class='fa fa-plus-square'></i> uniform, clear and clean system of documentation and help  

--
<i class='fa fa-minus-square'></i> difficulties due to a limited object-oriented programming capabilities,  
e.g. an agent-based simulation is a challenge  

--
<i class='fa fa-plus-square'></i> good interconnectivity with compiled languages like Java or C    

--
<i class='fa fa-minus-square'></i> cannot order a pizza for you (?)  

--
<i class='fa fa-plus-square'></i> a very powerful ecosystem of packages  

--
<i class='fa fa-plus-square'></i> free and open source, GNU GPL and GNU GPL 2.0  

--
<i class='fa fa-plus-square'></i> easy to generate high quality graphics
