# Datasets  
Hands-on analysis of actual data is the best way to learn R programming. This page contains some data sets that you can use to explore what you have learned in this course. For each data set, a brief description as well as download instructions are provided. 

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong> Try to focus on using the tools from the course to explore the data, rather than worrying about producing a perfect report with a coherent analysis workflow.</strong>
</div>


On the last day you will present your Rmd file (or rather, the resulting html report) and share with the class what your data was about.
