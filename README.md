:exclamation: Do not push any rendered .html files or intermediates.

## Repo organisation

The source material is located on the *master* branch (default). The rendered material is located on the *gh-pages* branch. For most part, one only needs to update content in master. Changes pushed to the *master* branch is automatically rendered to the *gh-pages* branch.

:exclamation: The first build can take around 30-40 mins depending on the number of R packages (listed in **_site.yml**). Subsequent builds take about 2-3 minutes since caching is enabled. Caches are removed after 7 days of last access. A push after that will require a full rebuild. If you want to add new packages related to labs please add them to line **24**. For core packages please use line **21**.

### Schedule
Schedule is saved into the `schedule.csv` file. It is a csv file with semi-colon as delimiter. You should NOT try to edit it in a text editor, but use proper spreadsheet.
If you are using command line, you can install `vd` and open and edit the file `vd --csv-delimiter ';' schedule.csv`.
