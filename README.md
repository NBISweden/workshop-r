:exclamation: When updating repo for a new course, change `output_dir: XXXX` in `_site.yml` as the first thing, so that old rendered files are not overwritten.

:exclamation: Do not push any rendered .html files or intermediates.

### Local build/preview using Docker

You can preview changes and build the whole website locally without a local installation of R or dependency packages by using the pre-built Docker image.

:exclamation: **Note:** Large image size: 4.3GB.

Clone the repo if not already done. Make sure you are standing in the repo directory.

To build the complete site,

```
docker run --rm -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v ${PWD}:/rmd ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-r:latest
```

To build a single file (for example `index.Rmd`),

```
docker run --rm -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v ${PWD}:/rmd ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-r:latest Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("index.Rmd")'
```

See **Dockerfile** to build the image.

:exclamation: Output files are for local preview only. Do not push any rendered .html files or intermediates.

## Repo organisation

The source material is located on the *master* branch (default). The rendered material is located on the *gh-pages* branch. For most part, one only needs to update content in master. Changes pushed to the *master* branch is automatically rendered to the *gh-pages* branch.

:exclamation: Every push rebuilds the whole website using a docker image. Build takes about 6 mins.

### Schedule

Schedule is saved into the `schedule.csv` file. It is a csv file with semi-colon as delimiter. You should NOT try to edit it in a text editor, but use proper spreadsheet.
If you are using command line, you can install `vd` and open and edit the file `vd --csv-delimiter ';' schedule.csv`.
