### Schedule

Schedule is saved into the `schedule.csv` file. It is a csv file with semi-colon as delimiter. You should NOT try to edit it in a text editor, but use proper spreadsheet.
If you are using command line, you can install `vd` and open and edit the file `vd --csv-delimiter ';' schedule.csv`.
